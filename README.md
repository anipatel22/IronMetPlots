# met-plotter
This repository contains a python file that can be used to make high quality plots for iron meteorites in element vs. element space (ex. Ge (ppm) vs Ni (wt%) ). It already has data inputted for many iron groups, including ungrouped irons, and I expect more groups to be added. Currently, it only has data for Ge, Ga, and Ni. However, I expect to add more elements as well, including HSEs. This program is particularly useful if one wants to plot a new meteorite sample and see how it compares to already established iron groups or ungrouped irons.
